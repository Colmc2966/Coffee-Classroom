            <h1>The Roasting of a Bean</h1>
            <h5>Wednesday, 6th of April</h5>
            <p>Raw coffee beans are dropped into loaders and then into a rotating drum. The drum is pre-heated to a temperature of around 240 degrees. After 12-15 minutes depending on the type of roast, the roasted beans will exit the drum at around 195 degrees and are then taken out into a cooling tray at the front of the roaster.</p>

            <h1>Multi-Origin Blends</h1>
            <h5>Monday, 4th of April</h5>
            <p>Believe it or not, most of your favourite coffee beans are orchastrated from multiple different countries. Coffee producers have been getting so advanced with their methods that they are taking what they believe to be the best suiting single-origin coffee beans and mixing them with other complimenting beans. For example, a lovely blend of beans called "sirens blend" is a compilation of beautifully zesty Rwandan coffee beans mixed with smooth cocoa flavoured columbian beans.
                Producers have been using this method to really surprise and delight coffee lovers with an endless combination of coffee which leads to infinite different flavours of coffee! Of course some are tasting and coming out better then others but that is all preference. Due to this method coffee lovers are really getting spoilt for choice!
