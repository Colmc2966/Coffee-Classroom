            <h1>The Roasting of a Bean</h1>
            <h5>Wednesday, 6th of April</h5>
            <p>Roasting is the method coffee farmers use to bring out the aroma and flavor that is hidden inside green coffee beans. Although beans are stored in their green state which enables them to keep their quality and taste. Green beans have no characteristics of a roasted bean. It actually has the opposite, green beans are soft spongy with no significant tastes or smells other then "grassy". Roasting beans cause a chemical change to take place. This is odne by rapidly bringing the temperature of the beans to very high. When they are roasted to the roasters preferance , they are quickly cooled off to stop the process.</p>
            <p>Raw coffee beans are dropped into loaders and then into a rotating drum. The drum is pre-heated to a temperature of around 240 degrees. After 12-15 minutes depending on the type of roast, the roasted beans will exit the drum at around 195 degrees and are then taken out into a cooling tray at the front of the roaster. </p>

            <h1>Multi-Origin Blends</h1>
            <h5>Monday, 4th of April</h5>
            <p>Believe it or not, most of your favourite coffee beans are orchastrated from multiple different countries. Coffee producers have been getting so advanced with their methods that they are taking what they believe to be the best suiting single-origin coffee beans and mixing them with other complimenting beans. For example, a lovely blend of beans called "sirens blend" is a compilation of beautifully zesty Rwandan coffee beans mixed with smooth cocoa flavoured columbian beans.
                Producers have been using this method to really surprise and delight coffee lovers with an endless combination of coffee which leads to infinite different flavours of coffee! Of course some are tasting and coming out better then others but that is all preference. Due to this method coffee lovers are really getting spoilt for choice!

            <h1>What is an Americano?</h1>
            <h5>Wednesday, 30th of March</h5>
            <br>
            <p>One of the most asked questions regarding coffee culture is regarding the world renowned Americano. The Americano is a minimalists dream coffee! All this beverage consists of is Espresso shots and boiling hot water mixed together. The Americano portrays coffee for what it is, depending on the beans. It highlights the rich and smooth tastes of certain medium roasts, the bold and heavy tastes of some dark roasts and the light and sweet tastes of some light roasts.
                The Americano is the original Italian methos of diluting espresso shots to not be as heavy. Nowadays there are multiple other drinks like the Americano such as the Gran Lungo which is 2 shots of coffee and 150ml of boiling water. However in my opinion, any form of espresso shots mixed with hot water is an Americano no matter the overall quantity of water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately making this renowned drink at home is tricky as you will need an espresso machine or an espresso maker. The bean-to-cup espresso machines come at a high price while the more commonly known plain espresso machines have a much more consumer friendly price point but can leave the customer with a lot of confusion and study to do. Once you get used to whatever espresso machine you purchase, making an Americano is an easy feat! All it takes is a shot of espresso and some of your own hot water from a kettle mixed together!
