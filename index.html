            <h6>Monday, April 25th</h6>
            <p id="blog-highlight-text">Hi guys, today we are going to do a much requested review of one of Nespresso's 
                flagship machines. This will be a nice change as we are looking into a capsule based machine today 
                instead of our usual fresh grind machine. Nespresso have succeeded in making coffee capsules mainstream 
                with their products. Ease of access, good prices, interesting flavours and great customer service 
                policies are what has really enabled this model to succeed. 

                Lets dig into the machine then. The Vertuo Next has a detachable 1 litre water tank on the back of the 
                machine.... <a href="#">Read more</a>

            <p id="bean-highlight-text">
                Our bean of the week this week is Kenya. This bean is one of the worlds most renowned beans
                for its juicy and complex nature. With tastes of fruity citrus leading to its beautifully sweet
                tastes. This bean is generally not mixed and made to a medium roast leading to a medium acidity and body.
