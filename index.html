            <br>
            <p id="blog-highlight-text">Hi guys, today we are going to do a much requested review of one of Nespresso's 
                flagship machines. This will be a nice change as we are looking into a capsule based machine today 
                instead of our usual fresh grind machine. Nespresso have succeeded in making coffee capsules mainstream 
                with their products. Ease of access, good prices, interesting flavours and great customer service 
                policies are what has really enabled this model to succeed. 

                Lets dig into the machine then. The Vertuo Next has a detachable 1 litre water tank on the back of the 
                machine.... <a href="blogs.html">Read more blogs</a>

            <br>
            <p id="bean-highlight-text">
                Our bean of the week this week is Kenya. This bean is one of the worlds most renowned beans
                for its juicy and complex nature. With tastes of fruity citrus leading to its beautifully sweet
                tastes. This bean is generally not mixed and made to a medium roast leading to a medium acidity and body. Kenya is best paired with some light shavings of orange peels when made in a cold brew. 
                Starbucks are the main sellers of this blend and have donated over 140 million dollars to kenya to ramp up their production and their farms. They are also giving farmers a very comptetitive pay too. Starbucks have a distribution center in Kenya too with over 110 locals working for them!

        <h1> Roast Reviews</h1>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h2>Pike Place</h2>
            <br>
            <p>This blend is one of Starbucks flagship blends primarily used in their filter coffee. This was the first blend that they ever used back in 1973. Pike place is a beautifully chocolately coffee with hints of nuts. It is a medium roast with medium acididty and body. When you taste this coffee it should sit in the middle of your tongue and  wash away quickly. Personally this is one of my go-to blends due to the "comforting" feeling it gives with every sip!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Sirens Blend</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Sirens blend is a multi origin coffee from Latin America and Afirca. It boasts smooth tastes of chocolate with zests of orange flavor. This blend pairs beautifully with orange flavoured chocolate and with a lemon tart or loaf! This coffee is medium acidity/body/roast and is just a joy to drink. It's hard to drink a lot of it though as it leaves your mouth quite dry after a couple of mouthfulls but nonetheless is a great blend that I believe everyone should try at least once.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>House Blend</h2>
            <br>
            <p>House blend is a Latin American blend which shows off gorgeous tastes of nuts. It is a lively blend with hints of banana. It's another medium roast/body/acidity but this one does not wash away as quickly. I find it to be a great coffee to have in the morning time, particularly with a big breakfast. This coffee pairs extremely well with almond fingers and banana bread. It is another of my favourite coffees and has served me well over the last 5 years.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Sumatra blend </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Sumatra is an extremely interesting blend that a lot of people either love it or hate it. This coffee has a very intense taste of herbs and is quite earthy. It is a dark roast with a full body and low acidity. It is a full mouthed coffee that washes away very slowly and has a complex taste. This coffee pairs very well with cinnamon buns, cheese or butter. Personally I do enjoy this blend but only every once in a while.</p>
