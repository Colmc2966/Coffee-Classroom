            <p id="blog-highlight-text">Hi guys, today we are going to do a much requested review of one of Nespresso's 
                flagship machines. This will be a nice change as we are looking into a capsule based machine today 
                instead of our usual fresh grind machine. Nespresso have succeeded in making coffee capsules mainstream 
                with their products. Ease of access, good prices, interesting flavours and great customer service 
                policies are what has really enabled this model to succeed. 

                Lets dig into the machine then. The Vertuo Next has a detachable 1 litre water tank on the back of the 
                machine. <a href="#">Click here to view rest of this blog</a>
